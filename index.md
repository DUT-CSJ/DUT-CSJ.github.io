Brief introduction: Both static and moving objects usually exist in real-life videos. Most video object segmentation methods only focus on exacting and exploiting motion cues to perceive moving objects. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive multi-source predictor for zero-shot video object segmentation. In the static object predictor, the RGB source is converted to depth and static saliency sources, simultaneously. In the moving object predictor, we propose the multi-source fusion structure. Furthermore, we design a feature purification module (FPM) to filter the inter-source incompatible features.<br />
