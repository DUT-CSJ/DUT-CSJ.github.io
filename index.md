## Bio
I am currently a first-year MSc. student advised by Prof. Lihe Zhang.

My research interests include video object segmentation and few-shot segmentation.

## Research Highlights

### Video Segmentation
**Video Instance Segmentation**<br />
Linjie Yang, **Yuchen Fan**, Ning Xu<br />
ICCV 2019 [[Paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.04804) [[Code]](https://github.com/youtubevos/MaskTrackRCNN) [[Dataset]](https://youtube-vos.org/dataset/vis/)<br />

We present a new computer vision task, named video instance segmentation. The goal of this new task is simultaneous detection, segmentation and tracking of instances in videos. To facilitate research on this new task, we propose a large-scale benchmark called YouTube-VIS, which consists of 2883 high-resolution YouTube videos, a 40-category label set and 131k high-quality instance masks. In addition, we propose a novel algorithm called MaskTrack R-CNN for this task. Our new method introduces a new tracking branch to Mask R-CNN to jointly perform the detection, segmentation and tracking tasks simultaneously.<br />


**Adaptive Multi-source Predictor for Zero-shot Video Object Segmentation**<br />

Learning long-term spatial-temporal features are critical for many video analysis tasks. End-to-end sequential learning to explore spatial-temporal features for video segmentation is largely limited by the scale of available video segmentation datasets. To solve this problem, we build a new large-scale video object segmentation dataset called YouTube Video Object Segmentation dataset (YouTube-VOS). Our dataset contains 3,252 YouTube video clips and 78 categories including common objects and human activities.<br />
